## Summary  
  
Control microphone and speaker audio levels.
  
## Requirements  
[PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) is required and installed by default with most Linux
distributions.
  
## Description  
  
This skill controls the audio level and mute status for the default input and output device. You may increment volume,
set to a specified level, or mute/unmute. You may also query the current volume and microphone level.
    
  
  
## Examples  
  
First, make your request:  
  
Say `“Hey Neon”` if you are in the wake words mode.
  
- "mute speakers"
      
- "unmute speakers"
      
- “set microphone to 70 percent”
      
- “decrease volume”

- "what is the volume"

Neon will respond with the new audio level.

## Troubleshooting
Make sure the correct default audio devices are selected (see `3. Setting Up Hardware` in the instructions).
